# CIFAR-10-Classification
A model to classify every image in CIFAR-10 Dataset using Neural Networks
The objective of the model is to accurately classify images into 10 different classes, utilizing the inherent structure of the backbone architecture and incorporating novel techniques. The network was trained on the CIFAR-10 training set and evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance. The report describes the modified network architecture, the training process, and the evaluation results.
